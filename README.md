# my_python_learning_journey
Python Fundamentals Bootcamp for Bioinformatics

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of practice exercises and code snippets from my journey to solidify fundamental Python programming concepts. These exercises are specifically tailored to build a strong foundation for future applications in bioinformatics, computational biology, and data analysis.

## Repository Structure and Content

This repository is organized into distinct modules, mirroring a structured learning bootcamp. Each folder corresponds to a key Python concept, containing Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) with practice tasks and solutions.

The modules covered include:

-   Module 1: Variables, Data Types & Basic Operations:** Practice with numbers, strings, booleans, and fundamental arithmetic/string operations.
-   Module 2: Control Flow (Decision Making & Loops):** Exercises on `if`/`elif`/`else` statements, `for` loops, `while` loops, and combining conditional logic.
-   Module 3: Data Structures:** Detailed practice with Lists (indexing, slicing, modification) and Dictionaries (key-value pairs, access, manipulation).
-   Module 4: Functions:** Learning to define reusable code blocks, use parameters, handle return values (single, multiple, implicit), and understand variable scope.
-   Module 5: File Handling:** (Upcoming) Practice reading from and writing to plain text files.
-   Module 6: Error Handling:** (Upcoming) Learning to anticipate and gracefully manage errors in code.

## Tech Used

-   Python:** The core programming language.
-   Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and clear documentation of practice steps.
-   Conda / Miniconda:** For managing Python environments and dependencies.

By completing these exercises, I'm developing a strong practical command of Python fundamentals, enabling me to build basic scripts, understand existing code, and prepare for more advanced computational tasks in scientific research.
